# Matching Game

## Overview

This project was taken on as my solo project for my first chingu voyage. Its tier 2. I chose this as it is a good way to put the skills I have learned into practice the skills with a simple, interactive application

Players can click or tap on each card to flip it over.There are 8 pairs of matching cards. If the cards match they stay flipped over,if they aren’t they flip back. Once the player has discovered all 8 pairs, they get the “YOU WON” Message
