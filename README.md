# Matching Game

## Overview

This project was taken on as my solo project for my first [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) voyage - its tier 2. I chose this as it is a good way to put the skills I have learned into practice with a simple, interactive application

Players can click or tap on each card to flip it over.There are 8 pairs of matching cards. If the cards match they stay flipped over, if they aren’t they flip back. Once the player has discovered all 8 pairs, they get the “YOU WON” Message

[See the app here](https://jondhill333.github.io/matching_game/)
